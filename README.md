# Lets Git Together


# Pracice your Git and GitHub exercises here.


There are two branches 'master' and 'scripts'.

There are two files 'file1.txt' and 'file2.txt' in the master branch.

There is one sample script for git commands 'printemail.sh' in the 'scripts' branch.


'file1.txt' gets words for 'a' to 'z'.

'file2.txt' gets numbers in words.

'scripts' branch gets the  for Git commands.


# All files are publicly open to practive their Git and GitHub exercises.


# On 'master' branch :


Append your words for any alphabet just in that row to the 'file1.txt'.

Append your numbers in words to 'file2.txt'.


# On 'scripts' branch :
Push your scripts and alias for Git commands to 'scripts' branch.


# Push your changes one at a time to practice more and more.
