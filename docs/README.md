# Lets Git Together


# Practice your Git and GitHub exercises here.


There are two branches 'master' and 'scripts'.

There are two files 'file1.txt' and 'file2.txt' in the master branch.

There is one sample script 'printemail.sh' for Git commands in the 'scripts' branch.


'file1.txt' gets words for 'a' to 'z'.

'file2.txt' gets numbers in words.

'scripts' branch gets the  for Git commands.


# On 'master' branch :


Append your words for any alphabet just in that row to the 'file1.txt'.

Append your numbers in words to 'file2.txt'.


# On 'scripts' branch :
Push your scripts and alias for Git commands to 'scripts' branch.
